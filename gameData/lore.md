# VoidPhoenix Lore (MVP)

In the Void, stars collapse into memory.  
Somewhere between ash and signal, a Phoenix learns to reboot reality.

**Factions**
- The Ember Archivists: keepers of dead timelines
- The Null Choir: sings errors into existence
- The Ashbound: those who returned without permission

**Promise**
Rebirth is not the end — it's a rewrite.
